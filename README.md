# Graysky

Graysky is a Bluesky client written in React Native. 🚧 WIP 🚧

> I've only tested this on iOS, your mileage may vary on Android.

## Getting Started

You'll need pnpm, and some sort of simulator or device to run the app on.

```bash
pnpm install
```

> Weird side step - you need to go to `apps/expo/app.config.ts` and delete the `extra` field which has an expo project id in it. Sorry, I'll fix this later.

You can then start the expo server with:

```bash
pnpm dev:expo
```

(Note: this is just a shortcut for `expo start`)

Then just scan the QR code!
